To make a profolio web page containing work examples of skills i have developed.

## User Story

- As a developer i want to show case the skills i have learnt and developed

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN page to be sampled by potentional employers
- WHEN My page showcase information about me and skills i have developed
- WHEN my page is interactive
- WHEN my page has and enables easy navigation
- WHEN my page forms in a set sequence
- WHEN my layout adapts between differnt view ports and screens
- When my page showscases a range of skills using css and html 

My main issue was insuring my html worked so my page layout formed to the search engine allowing for easier use of css. I stuggled mainly with div boxes however nearer the end of my task i was able to resolve the issue.

## General info
 This is a page developed through html and later styled through CSS. The lay out of the page was used using semantic html elements enabling description to the browser and myself. This allowed for more thought into the structure of the page to enable me to show case the skills i have learnt through css and html.
