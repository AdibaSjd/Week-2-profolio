# creating a portfolio web page
To make a portfolio web page containing work examples of skills I have developed. 

## User Story

- As a developer I want to show case the skills I have learnt and developed 
- So, my site is able to translate my abilities and skills to potential employers 



## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN page to be sampled by protentional employers 
- WHEN My page showcase information about me and skills i have developed 
- WHEN my page is interactive 
- WHEN my page has and enables easy navigation 
- WHEN my page forms in a set sequence 
- WHEN my layout adapts between different view ports and screens 
- When my page showcases a range of skills using CSS and html  


My main issue was ensuring my flex boxes space out evenly across the page so my page layout formed to the search engine allowing for easier use of CSS. However, nearer the end of my task I was able to resolve the issue by using the inspect on google which help immensely. 

## General info
 This is a page developed through html and later styled through CSS. The lay out of the page was done using semantic html elements enabling description to the browser and myself. This allowed for more thought into the structure of the page to enable me to show case the skills I have learnt through CSS and html.
